A) A complexe real-time systems whose requirements can be relatively identified and are stable
The water fall model because it can easily  understand and manage which is the most straight forward sdlc models 
b) A web-site for a local library. Requirements are vague and are likely to change in the future.
The incremental and irritative model.
This is because this sdlc model entails some customers involvement because of the possible need in small requirements amendments during the development process 
c) An order processing system with a web-site for a local business. Requirements are vague but stable (i.e. unlikely to change in the near future).
The spiral model
This is a model where intensive customer involvement appears.IT can be involved in exploration and review stages of each cycle at the development stage,the customer amendment are not acceptable 
2) Describe the software process model that you have proposed in question 5(a) highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.

The waterfall model
In this stage through all development phases(analysis,design,coding,testing,deployment)the process move in a cascade mode.Each stage has concrete deliverable and is strictly documented.the next stage cannot start before the previous one is completed(that is finishing one phase before going to another one)
There is also no ability to see and try the software until the last process is complete otherwise the model is easy to understand and manage
